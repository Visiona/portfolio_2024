        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-4">CONTEXT</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">In 2016, I was approached by a friend to assist with the website for a unique Fellowship he was
          part of: the Polish-speaking Alcoholics Anonymous in Ireland. This organization is a branch of a global group
          dedicated to supporting individuals facing the challenges of alcoholism through the shared strength, hope, and
          experience of the 12-step program. Their website serves as an extension of their mission, providing resources
          and support for their members.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-3">GOALS</h2>
        <ul class="mb-5">
          <li>Create a redesigned site that aligns with the latest trends and is optimised for mobile and tablet
            devices.</li>
          <li>Restructure the entire information architecture to ensure the content hierarchy meets user needs.</li>
          <li>Collaborate on creating essential content copy.</li>
          <li>Make the website user-centered and accessible, supporting AA’s 7th tradition of “Carrying the message to
            the alcoholic who still suffers.”</li>
          <li>Position site so it's easy to find via modern search engines and social media</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-3">PROJECT CONSTRAINTS</h2>
        <p>The website for the Polish-speaking Alcoholics Anonymous in Ireland faces several unique challenges and
          constraints:</p>
        <ul class="mb-5">
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Rotating Management:</span> The website is managed by different AA members every
            two years, leading to varying levels of technical familiarity among its overseers.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">User Demographics:</span> The users include individuals with limited internet
            access and beginners in online navigation.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Adherence to AA's 12 Traditions:</span> The website design must align with AA’s
            principles, such as attraction over promotion, neutrality on external issues, and maintaining anonymity.
          </li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Design Guidelines:</span> There are no official AA design style guides, but
            design choices are limited to the colors and fonts commonly used in AA publications, respecting each group's
            autonomy.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Platform Limitations:</span> Hosted on Jimdo for cost-effectiveness and
            user-friendliness, the website faces restrictions in modifying its structure and appearance due to the
            platform’s constraints.</li>

        <p>The interactive design of the form interface significantly reduced the need for detailed instructions,
          leading to a 75% decrease in the Leadership Support Team's workload. User feedback was overwhelmingly
          positive, with many appreciating the form's ease of use and reliability. For example, users noted that
          whatever they left unfinished in the form, their data remained intact even when their connection dropped
          during travel. This form has now become a benchmark for similar projects at Accenture.</p>

            <blockquote>
              I wanted to share my feedback on Milo and Darek as we had a fantastic experience working with both of
              them. During Q2/Q3 of last year, we partnered with Darek and Milo on creating a new online form to support
              appointments to Senior Managing Director (SMD).  Darek created an online form for us using PowerApps and
              Milo created the output using Adobe InDesign. The PowerApps form was used by the candidates themselves
              and the InDesign product was used by HR, the Business and ultimately Ellyn Shook and Julie Sweet in the
              form of a two-page candidate template.  They took what was a two page PPT template and built a secure,
              online form and a slick output file that was created with a few steps in InDesign. This was a new concept
              and they worked together to help bring our vision
              to life. They were both extremely collaborative and continued to explore different aspects from a design
              perspective to help deliver what we needed.  They also worked within our timeline and met with us often to
              ensure they understood the requirements and business need. As a result, they spent many hours designing,
              testing and implementing for us.  They collaborated and contributed outside of their immediate team to add
              value – truly One Accenture.
