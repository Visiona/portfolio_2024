        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-4">CONTEXT</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">In 2015, I was approached by a friend to assist with the website for a unique Fellowship he was
          part of: the Polish-speaking Alcoholics Anonymous in Ireland. This organization is a branch of a global group
          dedicated to supporting individuals facing the challenges of alcoholism through the shared strength, hope, and
          experience of the 12-step program. Their website serves as an extension of their mission, providing resources
          and support for their members.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-3">GOALS</h2>
        <ul class="mb-5">
          <li>Create a redesigned site that aligns with the latest trends and is optimised for mobile and tablet
            devices.</li>
          <li>Restructure the entire information architecture to ensure the content hierarchy meets user needs.</li>
          <li>Collaborate on creating essential content copy.</li>
          <li>Make the website user-centered and accessible, supporting AA’s 7th tradition of “Carrying the message to
            the alcoholic who still suffers.”</li>
          <li>Position site so it's easy to find via modern search engines and social media</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-3">PROJECT CONSTRAINTS</h2>
        <p>The website for the Polish-speaking Alcoholics Anonymous in Ireland faces several unique challenges and
          constraints:</p>
        <ul class="mb-5">
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Rotating Management:</span> The website is managed by different AA members every
            two years, leading to varying levels of technical familiarity among its overseers.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">User Demographics:</span> The users include individuals with limited internet
            access and beginners in online navigation.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Adherence to AA's 12 Traditions:</span> The website design must align with AA’s
            principles, such as attraction over promotion, neutrality on external issues, and maintaining anonymity.
          </li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Design Guidelines:</span> There are no official AA design style guides, but
            design choices are limited to the colors and fonts commonly used in AA publications, respecting each group's
            autonomy.</li>
          <li><span class="mark-yellow">Platform Limitations:</span> Hosted on Jimdo for cost-effectiveness and
            user-friendliness, the website faces restrictions in modifying its structure and appearance due to the
            platform’s constraints.</li>

        <h3 class="heading-h3 mb-2">Usability testing</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">In this UX research phase, I aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the new Alcoholics Anonymous website in meeting user needs and expectations.</p>
        The primary objectives of the study were:
        <ul>
          <li>determine whether users could easily find the information they were seeking</li>
          <li>assess whether the list of meetings met user expectations</li>
          <li>gauge if the website effectively motivated users to attend meetings</li>
          <li>observe user behavior and navigation patterns to identify any pain points or barriers to a smooth experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-3">To achieve these goals, I conducted a series of A/B tests, unmoderated remote usability testing, and in-depth user interviews. These methods allowed me to gather both quantitative and qualitative data, providing a comprehensive understanding of user satisfaction, the efficiency of the website, and its ability to attract newcomers while serving the informational needs of existing members of the Fellowship.

        <p>After addressing the issues identified in the wireframes, we developed a style guide to establish the app's visual identity and design guidelines. This ensured a consistent, scalable, and flexible layout, making it easier to design and update elements as needed.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">The AA Fellowship does not have established brand styles, so I chose colors that closely relate to its identity, specifically blue and yellow, which are featured on the covers of the "Big Book"—a central text in AA. Based on feedback indicating that the blue and yellow scheme in Website 2.0 conveyed a somber and cold impression, I decided to incorporate additional orange and red hues from the original 1940s edition of the book. This adjustment not only adds warmth to the design but also maintains visual consistency with other AA sites worldwide.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-h3 mb-4 mt-5">Typography & UI elements</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">I decided to retain the Jimdo CMS for the site due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of maintenance, and familiarity among some AA members. This platform offered a limited selection of fonts, with Tinos being one of the available options. Tinos is a web-friendly, browser-compatible, and open-source font that includes Polish glyphs and ensures readability and legibility. Despite offering only Regular and Bold styles, Tinos contributes to visual consistency and simplicity in maintenance, particularly for users without a design background. Additionally, its unique characteristics enhance the site's individuality.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-h3 mb-2">Impact and Achievements Post-Launch</h3>
        <p>Two years following the launch of Website 3.0, traffic and user engagement significantly exceeded expectations. The site’s enhanced responsiveness, including a tailored mobile version, contributed to a marked increase in mobile visits. The innovative approach taken for the AA site—integrating all AA meetings directly on the homepage—set a precedent, as this solution uniquely positions meetings as the primary tool for individuals seeking support and for AA's mission delivery.</p>

          <p>The Polish-speaking AA community in Ireland received numerous inquiries from other Polish-speaking regional groups across Europe, seeking permission to replicate the website's successful model, such as aaaustria.com.</p>
          
          <p>Since the website's launch, fellowship members have become more engaged in content creation, fostering stronger cooperation among groups in Ireland. The platform has also enhanced technological connectivity and continues to attract increasing visitor numbers each quarter, as demonstrated by the ongoing metrics.</p>
