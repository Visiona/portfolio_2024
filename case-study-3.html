        <h2 class="heading-h2 mb-4">CONTEXT</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">The Accenture Senior Executive Support team, collaborating with the CEO Julie Sweet, sought to
          redesign a Power Point completed by Senior Managing Director candidates. When discussing the initial brief, I
          realised redesigning wouldn’t be an answer to their problem, that a new process would bring a real relief to
          their challenges. The existing process was cumbersome. Previous process consisted of gathering input from
          approximately 80 candidates for the Senior Managing Director role at Accenture via a pre-styled PowerPoint
          template. The slides submitted by applicants required extensive manual editing, resending slides to users, lot
          of copying and pasting to create polished presentations for final C-suite review and approval. This workflow
          generated overload in communication between the Support Team and Senior Executives. Since the Accenture CEO
          was the final reviewer, it was crucial to have the applications well-polished and easy to review.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">Before I could design the new application process, it was crucial to thoroughly understand the
          existing system and its pain points. To achieve this, I analyzed applicant data collected in a detailed
          PowerPoint presentation. This analysis revealed several issues that needed to be addressed.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">I have interviewed two members of the Support Team to understand the challenges of the current
          project while observing the process they go through from the start to the end of preparing ppt for candidates
          and when these are completed, then observing the process of managing the completed slides when they
          extensively edit them and merge into one presentation that would normally go to CEO for review. Here is a
          sample of some questions I asked:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you see as the primary function of the ppt slides is?</li>
          <li>What do you like about the existing process (bright sides)?</li>
          <li>What don’t you like about the existing process (pain points)?</li>
          <li>What improvements could be made to make this process easier or better?</li>
          <li>How long do you expect the whole project to take, what are the stages?</li>
          <li>Please walk me through the process form the beginning of preparing the Power Point slides, through
            completion up to preparing completed forms for CEO.</li>

        <p>The interactive design of the form interface significantly reduced the need for detailed instructions,
          leading to a 75% decrease in the Leadership Support Team's workload. User feedback was overwhelmingly
          positive, with many appreciating the form's ease of use and reliability. For example, users noted that
          whatever they left unfinished in the form, their data remained intact even when their connection dropped
          during travel. This form has now become a benchmark for similar projects at Accenture.</p>

            <blockquote>
              I wanted to share my feedback on Milo and Darek as we had a fantastic experience working with both of
              them. During Q2/Q3 of last year, we partnered with Darek and Milo on creating a new online form to support
              appointments to Senior Managing Director (SMD).  Darek created an online form for us using PowerApps and
              Milo created the output using Adobe InDesign. The PowerApps form was used by the candidates themselves
              and the InDesign product was used by HR, the Business and ultimately Ellyn Shook and Julie Sweet in the
              form of a two-page candidate template.  They took what was a two page PPT template and built a secure,
              online form and a slick output file that was created with a few steps in InDesign. This was a new concept
              and they worked together to help bring our vision
              to life. They were both extremely collaborative and continued to explore different aspects from a design
              perspective to help deliver what we needed.  They also worked within our timeline and met with us often to
              ensure they understood the requirements and business need. As a result, they spent many hours designing,
              testing and implementing for us.  They collaborated and contributed outside of their immediate team to add
              value – truly One Accenture.
