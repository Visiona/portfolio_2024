                  <p>In 2016, I was asked by a friend to help with the website for the Polish-speaking Alcoholics
                    Anonymous (AA) in Ireland, a group dedicated to supporting individuals facing alcoholism through
                    mutual aid and the 12-step program. The existing website faced multiple challenges: it was managed
                    by AA members with varying technical skills, catered to users with limited internet access and
                    online navigation skills, and needed to adhere to AA's 12 traditions, including anonymity and
                    non-promotion. Additionally, the site was hosted on Jimdo for cost-effectiveness, which limited
                    structural and design modifications. The mission was to disseminate information about
                    Polish-speaking AA meetings in Ireland and AA as a whole to alcoholics who had access to the
                    internet.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 pl-md-5">
                  <p>I conducted thorough research, including surveys, site analytics, and user interviews, which
                    informed the creation of personas and user journeys. Using this data, I developed wireframes,
                    prototypes, affinity maps, and style guides within the design constraints of AA's traditional colors
                    and fonts. Two years after the website's launch, it received inquiries from other Polish-speaking AA
                    groups in Europe, who used aairlandia.com as a model for their own websites, such as aaaustria.com.
                    The new website increased fellowship members' involvement in content creation and strengthened
                    connections with other AA groups in Ireland, leading to a consistent rise in visitor numbers each
                    quarter.</p>
