                <p> The Accenture Senior Executive Support team, in collaboration with CEO Julie Sweet, sought to
                  address the cumbersome process of gathering input from approximately 80 candidates for the Senior
                  Managing Director role. The existing method involved using a pre-styled PowerPoint template that
                  required extensive manual editing, leading to frequent back-and-forth communication and a high
                  workload for both the Support Team and Senior Executives. The primary goals were to create a new
                  submission process that would reduce communication overload, simplify the user experience for
                  applicants, and improve the review process for leadership.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6 pl-md-5">
                <p>Realizing that redesigning the PowerPoint template alone wouldn't solve the problem, I proposed and
                  implemented a new process. I conducted interviews and usability testing with two target groups—admin
                  users and form users—to gather insights. This led to the development of a streamlined user flow and
                  interactive form interface through design thinking sessions and interaction design. The new form
                  interface significantly reduced the need for detailed instructions, resulting in a 75% decrease in the
                  Leadership Support Team's workload. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, particularly
                  highlighting the form's ease of use and reliability, even retaining data when connections dropped.
                  This form has now set a new standard for similar projects within Accenture.</p>
