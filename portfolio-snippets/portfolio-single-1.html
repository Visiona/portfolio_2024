                <p>Accenture aimed to enhance the quarterly promotion announcement process by significantly increasing
                  the list of promoted employees from about 5,000 to up to 100,000 globally, and making the site more
                  user-friendly and secure. The existing site was not equipped to handle such a large dataset and lacked
                  adequate filtering options, which made it challenging for users to search and navigate through the
                  names. Additionally, there was a need to ensure the new solution would be cost-effective and secure,
                  while catering to both leadership and other employee levels.</p>

                <p>As the designer, I conducted extensive research and usability testing, and developed wireframes to
                  address these needs. Using Accenture's existing technologies—SharePoint, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—I
                  implemented 10 interactive, multi-select filters akin to familiar Excel patterns, added name-based
                  search capabilities, and ensured the site was private despite being hosted on SharePoint. I also
                  created a simplified 7-step maintenance process for non-coders, integrated a feedback form for
                  continuous improvement, and linked names to internal profiles. The result was a significant success:
                  visitor numbers surged by over 100%, reaching 160k views in the first week of December FY24, and the
                  project was praised as a benchmark for other clients and internal sites, setting new standards across
                  Europe and the USA.</p>
